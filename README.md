# Code and other materials from SAS Global Forum 2019

This repository features a selection of SAS code contributions that accompany the papers and presentations from SAS Global Forum 2019.  All code that is shared here might exist other places, such as in the author's personal GitHub, [SAS Support Communities](https://communities.sas.com), or simply as text within the published proceedings.  The paper authors have completed this extra step to make their example code easier to find and consume.

After the conference, you can find the directory of the published proceedings from SAS Global Forum 2019 at the [SAS Global Forum home](https://www.sas.com/en_us/events/sas-global-forum/program/proceedings.html).  From there, you can search the proceedings by various categories, including: topic, product, industry, skill level and job role.
